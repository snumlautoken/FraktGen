# FraktGen
FraktGen is a program for generating and exploring fractals.

Make sure that you have `glfw` and `GLEW` installed.

Run `cmake .` followed by `make` to build the project. Binary is built to `src` directory.

At the moment only the MandelBrot set is able to be generated.

In order to zoom in on the fractal, simply hold and draw a box "from corner to corner".
